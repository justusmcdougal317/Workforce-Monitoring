Goal was to create a commandline apllication for tracking employee information. I used a schema.sql file for the creation of the tables in the database. I used a contents.sql file for the contents inside the table to be added to the ui and held in the database. I used a server.js file to create all the functions to interacrt with the database and make the ui achieve desired function, i used screencastify for the screen recording.Node.js, Mysql, console.table and inquirer where all the dependencies downloaded and used for the proper connections and functions to work.Commands to start application are "node server.js".
