Goal was to create a commandline apllication for tracking employee information. I used a schema.sql file for the creation of the tables in the database. I used a contents.sql file for the contents inside the table to be added to the ui and held in the database. I used a server.js file to create all the functions to interacrt with the database and make the ui achieve desired function, i used screencastify for the screen recording.Node.js, Mysql, console.table and inquirer where all the dependencies downloaded and used for the proper connections and functions to work.*RUN INSTRUCTIONS* (CLONE REPO IN VS CODE OR TERMINAL OF CHOICE,CD TO EMPLOYEE DATABASE, RUN "NPM I" COMMAND , THEN RUN "NODE SERVER.JS" AND ENJOY APP.)
